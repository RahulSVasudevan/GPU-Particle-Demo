# GPU-Particle-Demo

This demo explores the functionality of Compute & Geometry shaders. The particle properties are updated in the compute shader and the 
output is copied to the vertex buffer. The geometry shader expands the vertex into a quad and also does billboarding. The particles follow a spiral path.

# Performance

Able to render over 1 million particles at ~250 fps on an AMD Radeon RX580
